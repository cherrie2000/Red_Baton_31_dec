			<h1>Hacker News Reader</h1>

				<em>Unofficial UI for news.ycombinator.com</em>
			</small>
		</div>
		<p>This project was started out of frustration from lack of proper mobile layout and other minor annoyances.
		The main goal of the project is to give a more user friendly interface that should work on every platform. Mobile support is especially important. </p>

		<p><strong>Current features:</strong> </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Frontpage submissions and some simple sorting/filtering of those (new, top, Ask HN, etc.).</li>
			<li>Full support for comments viewing including polls and Ask HN posts. </li>
			<li>Can act as an API in reddit style (append .json to any page to get json output).</li>
			<li>Responsive layout thanks to Bootstrap (with some tweaking).</li>
			<li>Some comment enhancements like original posters name in a different color and comment collapsing. More planned. </li>
		</ul><p>Written in Python 2.7 and uses the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Django</li>
			<li>Bootstrap as a CSS framework</li>
			<li>BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML</li>
			<li>Sass/Compass for CSS</li>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>PostgreSQL</li>
			<li>Various timezone/time packages</li>
			<li>Check <a href="https://github.com/cXhristian/Hacker-News-Reader/blob/master/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a> for a full list of Python packages</li>
		</ul><p>Currently the project scrapes news.ycombinator.com directly which leads to some problems:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>One major problem is being unable to scrape older comments too often
				<ul>
					<li>The "official" api HNSearch doesn't allow fetching by id rendering it completely useless for my use and most of the other unofficial apis have some problems with the formatting. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Semi-random banning of the scrape IP.
				<ul>
					<li>Normally I would just scrape with different IP addresses, but currently the project is hosted on AppFog free tier which only gives me one IP. I have a working port for Google App Engine, but for some reason it is unable to scrape HN at all. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
